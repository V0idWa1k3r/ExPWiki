		<br>
		The bar on the left is a temperature indicator. If a campfire is lit and has fuel it will consume that fuel to raise the temperature.
		<br>
		The slot on the top is the item slot. Any item can be put in it and the campfire will heat that item up.
		<br>
		The 3 slots on the bottom are slots for fuel. Campfire will use the fuel to continue burning.
		<br>
		The maximum temperature the campfire can reach is 610 degrees.
		<br>
		Campfire is unaffected by <a href="/ExPWiki/bellows_manual.html">bellows</a>.
		<br>
		Campfire will drop as an item if the block it is placed on is not a solid block.
		<br>
		Campfire needs to be lit up in order to consume fuel and heat up. To lit the campfire up it must be right-clicked with a <a href="/ExPWiki/fire_starter.html">Fire Starter</a> or a <a href="/ExPWiki/flint_and_iron.html">Flint And Iron</a>.
		<br>
		Campfire will emit fire particles if it is lit up.
