		Barrel is a <strong>block</strong> added by ExPetrum.
		<br>
		Barrel can be obtained by crafting from 3 <a href="/ExPWiki/planks.html">Planks</a>, a <a href="/ExPWiki/saw.html">Saw</a> and 2 Copper Rims.
		<br>

		<br>
		Barrel has an interface that can be opened by right-clicking the Barrel:

		<br>
		The bar on the left is the fluid bar. It shows the current fluid in the barrel and it's amount.
		<br>
		The top slot is the input slot. This is the slot where the player puts the fluid containers to fill the barrel or items to imbue with the fluid.
		<br>
		The bottom slot is the output slot. This is the slot from which the player will take their produce after the recipe is complete or take empty containers from fluid vessels.
		<br>
		The main purpose of the barrel is to hold fluids. It can hold up to 10000mb of fluids.
		<br>
		Additionally some items may have specific barrel recipes. To perform the recipe the player must insert the item into the input slot while the barrel has the needed fluid and wait.
		<br>
		If right-clicked with a <a href="/ExPWiki/pottery.html">Ceramic Jug</a> while there is at least 100mb of fresh water in the barrel the jug will be filled.
		<br>
		If right-clicked with a glass bottle 250mb of fluid in the barrel might be transferred into the glass bottle.
		<br>
		The barrel keeps the fluid when broken and relocated but will drop any items in it.
