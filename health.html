		<h2>Health</h2>
		<br>
			 In ExPetrum health works differently to how it works in vanilla. <br>
		<strong>
			 Your maximum and base health is 5000 instead of 20. However all received damage is multiplied accordingly.
		</strong>
		<br>
		The amount of health you have is represented by the heart icon in the bottom left of your screen.
		<br>
		The text varies and represents the rough percentage of health you currently have:
		<br>
		<ul>
			<li> Healthy: 100% - 83% </li>
			<li> Injured: 83% - 66% </li>
			<li> Heavily Injured: 66% - 50% </li>
			<li> Dying: 50% - 33% </li>
			<li> Nearly Dead: 33% - 16% </li>
			<li> Dead: 16% - 0% </li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<h2>Health Regen</h2>
		<div w3-include-html="/templates/temp.html"></div>
		<br>
		The player slowly regenerates health at a rate of 10hp per 5 seconds 
		<br>
		<strong>or</strong>
		<br>
		if time was skipped(for example the player slept) then health regen is calculated for the time skipped by this formula: 
		<br>
		<strong>5 * (ticksSkipped / 100)</strong>.
		<br>
		Currently health regen is unaffected by thirst, hunger or illnesses.
