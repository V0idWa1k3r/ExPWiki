		</div>
		Charcoal pit is a dynamic multiblock structure.
		<br>
		Its purpose is the production of charcoal.
		<br>
		To build a charcoal pit the player must place log piles in a rectangular formation.
		<br>
		To place a log pile the player must shift right click a log on the ground and then they might add more logs to the pile by right clicking it.
		<br>
		The dimensions of the structure don't matter as long as it is a rectangle.

		<br>
		Once the structure is assembled it must be covered with solid blocks on all sides so no log pile is exposed to air on any side.
		<br>
		Finally a log pile must be lit on fire(presumably the top of it) and quickly covered with a solid block.
		<br>
		If all done correctly the player will see some smoke particles rising from the structure
		<br>
		It takes a minimum of 8 in-game hours for the piles to turn into charcoal.
