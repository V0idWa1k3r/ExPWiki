		The purpose of nesting boxes is to collect <a href="/ExPWiki/egg.html">Eggs</a> from <a href="/ExPWiki/chicken.html">Chickens</a>.
		<br>
		If a chicken trusts the player enough it will attempt to find a nesting box within a 16 block radius around itself to lay an egg in.
		<br>
		When a chicken lays an egg it ends up in the inventory of a nesting box provied that there is a slot for an egg.
		<br>
		Nesting boxes can also be used to incubate chickens from eggs.
		<br>
		If an egg is fertilized and at least 3 days have passed since the egg was layed the egg will be deleted and a new baby chicken will spawn on top of the nesting box.
		<br>
		Nesting boxes can hold up to 9 eggs at a time.
