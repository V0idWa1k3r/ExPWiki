		<h2>Hunger</h2>
		In ExPetrum the hunger mechanics are different from vanilla. The player has 2000 calories which slowly go down as time progresses. 
		<br>The calories value has no maximum and could in theory go above 2000.
		<br>
		The calories are removed by the following formula:
		<ul>
			<li>The base removal value is 0.05 per tick</li>
			<li>If the player is sprinting this value is multiplied by 2</li>
			<li>If time was skipped(for example the player slept) the removed value is calculated as ticksSkipped * value / 2</li>
			<li>If a player places a block the calories are reduced by 0.1</li>
			<li>If a player breaks a block the calories are reduced by 1</li>
		</ul>
		If the calories are less than or equal to 0 the player takes 1 point of Starvation damage every 2 seconds.
		<br>
		The hunger is displayed in the bottom-left of the screen and the text roughly represents the percentage of calories the player has left:
		<ul>
			<li>Saturated: Infinity - 100%</li>
			<li>Not Hungry: 100% - 83%</li>
			<li>Peckish: 83% - 66%</li>
			<li>Slightly Hungry: 66% - 50%</li>
			<li>Hungry: 50% - 33%</li>
			<li>Very Hungry: 33% - 16%</li>
			<li>Starving: 16% - 0%</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Food</h2>
		Each food has a certain amount of calories associated with it's weight. Every time a player eats they only eat enough to fill them to 2000.
