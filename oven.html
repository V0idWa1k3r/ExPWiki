		Oven is a <strong>block</strong> added by ExPetrum.
		<br>
		Oven can be obtained by crafting from 8 <a href="/ExPWiki/brick.html">Bricks</a> and a Bronze Double Sheet:

		<br>
		Oven has an interface that can be opened by right-clicking:

		<br>
		The bar on the left is the temperature bar.
		<br>
		The fluid bar to the right of the temperature bar represents the current amount of Olive/Walnut Oil in the oven.
		<br>
		The slot on the top-left is for the Oli containers(example: Olive Oil Bottle).
		<br>
		The slot on the bottom-left is for the result item from consuming the fluid container item(example: Glass Bottle).
		<br>
		The four slots on the top are for the items that the player wishes to cook.
		<br>
		The slot directly underneath the four slots is for fuel.
		<br>
		The maximum temperature the oven can reach is 500 degrees.
		<br>
		The oven is unaffected by <a href="/ExPWiki/bellows_manual.html">bellows</a>.
		<br>
		The oven needs to be lit up in order to consume fuel and heat up. To lit the oven up it must be right-clicked with a <a href="/ExPWiki/fire_starter.html">Fire Starter</a> or a <a href="/ExPWiki/flint_and_iron.html">Flint And Iron</a>.
		<br>
		The maximum amount of Oil the oven can hold in itself is 1000mb.
		<br>
		The oven is intended for cooking. While it can heat up any item it will heat up food related items twice as fast(20 degrees/second).
		<br>
		Additionally the oven has the ability to apply the Well Cooked status to cooked food making it rot at 35% the rate.
		<br>
		To apply that effect the oven must have at least 50mb of Olive or Walnut oil in it while cooking the item.
		<br>
		Upon cooking the oven will consume 50mb of oil and apply the Well Cooked status to the food.
		<br>
		This mechanic only applies to food items.
