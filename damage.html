			 <h1>Damage and Armor Systems</h1>
		</div>
		<h2>Body Parts</h2>
		In ExPetrum the player's body is divided into the following body parts:
		<ul>
			<li>Head: Protected by: Helmet</li>
			<li>Body: Protected by: Chestplate</li>
			<li>Left Arm: Protected by: Chestplate</li>
			<li>Right Arm: Protected by: Chestplate</li>
			<li>Left Leg: Protected by: Leggings, Boots</li>
			<li>Right Leg: Protected by: Leggings, Boots</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Damage</h2>
		The damage calculation steps for the player are as following:
		<ol>
			<li>At first a body part to damage is determined based on the source:
				   <ul>
				   	   <li>Anvil damage has a 92% chance of damaging the head and 8% chance of damaging the body.</li>
					   <li>Falling damage has a 95% chance of damaging either of the legs and a 5% chance of damaging the body</li>
					   <li>Crushing(falling block) damage has a 37% chance of damaging the head, 55% chance of damaging ether the body, the left arm or the right arm and a 8% chance of damaging either leg.</li>
					   <li>Hot floor(magma blocks) damage can damage either of the legs</li>
					   <li>Any other damage source will randomly select a body part to damage</li>
				  </ul>
			</li>
			<li>Based on the body part selected an armor damage reduction is applied.</li>
			<li>The damage to the body part is then applied. It is a random value [0-1] not based on the actual damage received. If no armor protection was applied that value is multiplied by 10.</li>
			<li>The actual damage is calculated by the following formula: <strong>amount * (200 +/-[0~50])</strong></li>
			<li>The health of the player is modified as currentHealth - damage</li>
			<li>If the health of the player is less than or equal to 0 then the player is killed</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>Armor Protection</h2>
		<div w3-include-html="/templates/temp.html"></div>
		Currently the armor protection for non-special mod armor only takes armor toughness attribute into account when calculation the amount of damage reduced.
		<br>
		Armor is damaged for half the damage received.
