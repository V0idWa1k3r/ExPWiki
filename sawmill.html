		<br>
		Sawmill is used to process logs into planks and wooden pulp.
		<br>
		In order to work a Sawmill must be supplied with rotary power.
		<br>
		The Sawmill requires a minimum of 64 speed and torque.
		<br>
		The Sawmill accepts power from the Sides.
		<br>
		The speed at which the Sawmill processes logs is calculated by the following formula:
		<br>
		speed + torque
		<br>
		In order for a log to be processed it needs to be placed directly underneath the sawmill.
		<br>
		Once the progress reaches 100% the log will be broken and 4 planks will be dropped alongside with 2 wooden pulps.
