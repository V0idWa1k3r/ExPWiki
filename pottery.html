			 <h1>Pottery</h1>
		</div>
		Pottery is a <strong>collection of blocks</strong> added by ExPetrum.
		<br>
		Pottery can be obtained by firing clay pottery.
		<br>
		Any pottery can be placed on the ground by right-clicking it on a block.
		<br>
		Any pottery can be collected by shift-right clicking on it.
		<br>
		There are currently 3 types of pottery:
		<br>
		<h2>Pots</h2>
		Pots can be opened with a right-click to access their inventory (4 slots).
		<br>
		When placed or broken pots retain their inventory.
		<br>
		If any meltable item is placed in a pot and it is heated up to the melting point of that item it will melt and the liquid metal will be stored inside of the pot.
		<br>
		Liqud metal in a pot can be cast into molds if a mold is inserted into the inventory of a pot.
		<br>
		It is worth noting that if the pot cools down enough the metal will solidify and won't be able to be casted. In order to allow casting the pot must be heated up again.
		<br>
		<h2>Jugs</h2>
		A jug can contain some water a player can drink by holding right-click with a filled jug.
		<br>
		Drinking from a jug restores 1000 points of thirst.
		<br>
		The jug can be filled by either right-clicking on a block of water or a barrel with at least 100mb of water.
		<br>
		<h2>Plates</h2>
		Plates are purely decorative.
