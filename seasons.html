		<h2>World Seasons</h2>
		In ExPetrum the world has 4 seasons it cycles through. Each season is different in both temperature and the effects of the season.
		<br>The following seasons exist:
		<ul>
			<li>Spring</li>
			<li>Summer</li>
			<li>Autumn</li>
			<li>Winter</li>
		</ul>
		The current season is displayed in the bottom-right corner of the screen.
		<br>
		Each season by default lasts 30 in-game days.
		<br>
		Each season has varying temperatures:
		<ul>
			<li>Spring: 
						<ul>
							<li>Early: -2 ~ +4</li>
							<li>Middle: +4 ~ +13</li>
							<li>End: +12 ~ +18</li>
						</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Summer: 
						<ul>
							<li>Early: +14 ~ +25</li>
							<li>Middle: +25 ~ +33</li>
							<li>End: +15 ~ +33</li>
						</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Autumn: 
						<ul>
							<li>Early: +2 ~ +28</li>
							<li>Middle: -1 ~ +9</li>
							<li>End: -14 ~ +3</li>
						</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Winter: 
						<ul>
							<li>Early: -29 ~ -9</li>
							<li>Middle: -23 ~ -13</li>
							<li>End: -12 ~ -2</li>
						</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		Different crops can grow during different seasons. Most crops however grow during all seasons but the winter.
		<br>
		During a season the appearance of grass, leaves and bushes might change.
		<br>
		During spring or summer leaves, grass and bushes will go into their normal state.
		<br>
		During autumn leaves, grass and bushes will go into their autumn state. More falling leaves particles will also spawn.
		<br>
		During winter leaves, grass and bushes will go into their dead state.
		<br>
		Additionally the state of leaves, grass and bushes generated in the world will match the season.
