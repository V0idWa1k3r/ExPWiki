		Mechanical Bellows is a <strong>block</strong> added by ExPetrum.

		<br>
		Mechanical Bellows are used to increase the maximum temperature of temperature-containing blocks.
		<br>
		To do this a player must place the bellows so they face the block in question.
		<br>
		Then the bellows must receive rotary power.
		<br>
		The formula for the speed at which the bellows will operate is as following:
		<br>
		speed + torque / 4
		<br>
		Mechanical bellows can accept rotary power from behind.
		<br>
		Mechanical Bellows typically increase the maximum temperature by 250 degrees up to the maximum of additional 750 degrees.
		<br>
		The increase in temperature in target block will slowly drop at a rate of 4 degrees per second.
