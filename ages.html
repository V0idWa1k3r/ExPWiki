		ExPetrum introduces a progression system that makes the player progress through Ages.
		<br>
		The progress through the ages is as following:
		<ol>
			<li>Stone Age</li>
			<li>Chalcolithic Age</li>
			<li>Bronze Age</li>
			<li>Iron Age</li>
			<li>Rotary Age</li>
			<li>Steel Age</li>
		</ol>
		The progression through ages is usually triggered by crafting a tool of that age with some exceptions:
		<ul>
			<li>The player starts in a Stone age</li>
			<li>Rotary age is triggered by crafting a gearbox</li>
		</ul>
		It is impossible to skip through ages. For example if a player managed to craft a bronze tool while still being in stone age the bronze age will not be triggered.
  		<br>
		The ages are purely visual changing the way player's hotbar looks as well as changing some other minor visual icons.
		<br>
		However with the achievement of Iron Age the player is able to more accurately determine the amount of fluid in their watering cans and wooden buckets.
